# python_tkinter_HM

This is a standalone Python Tkinter hotel management application designed to manage customer orders efficiently. The application includes various fields to calculate and manage customer orders, taxes, subtotal, total amount with taxes, and more. All the entered data is stored in a connected database.

I have developed three different variants of this project, each featuring unique functionalities to enhance overall management capabilities.

## Database

I have used Oracle Database to store data directly from all versions of the hotel management application. This ensures efficient and secure management of order records, providing robust data storage and retrieval capabilities across the application.

## 1) Hotel Management

1) Order Input Fields: Enter quantities for various food items like drinks, burgers, pizza, etc.
2) Order Summary: Displays details like order number, cost, service charges, tax, and total amount.
3) Built-in Calculator: Perform quick calculations with basic arithmetic functions.
4) Live Clock & Date: Shows the current time and date for reference.
5) Functional Buttons:
    Price: Calculate item costs.
    Total: Calculate the full total with taxes and service.
    Reset: Clear all fields.
    Exit: Close the application.
6) Submit Section: Save the order to the database.
